# Project Euler

## Introduction
In this branch I will submit an implementation of the problems presented in the webpage https://projecteuler.net/
Feel free to use this implementations.
Best regards,

## [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/multiplesOf3And5.cc)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

My implementation has an input parameter. This parameter N is the number which you want the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below this number.

## [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/evenFibonacciNumbers.cc)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

											1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
