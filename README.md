## Introduction
In this branch I will submit an implementation of the problems presented in the webpage https://projecteuler.net/
Feel free to use this implementations.

## [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/multiplesOf3And5.cc)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

My implementation has an input parameter. This parameter N is the number which you want the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below this number.

## [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/evenFibonacciNumbers.cc)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

											1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


## [Largest prime factor](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/largestPrimeFactor.cc)

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?


## [Largest palindrome product](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/largestPalindromeProduct.cc)

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


## [Smallest multiple](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/smallestMultiple.cc)

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


## [Sum square difference](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/sumSquareDifference.cc)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

											1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

											(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


## [10001st prime](https://github.com/tknbr/euler/blob/master/10001Prime.cc)


By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
