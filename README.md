## Introduction
### In this branch I will submit an implementation of the problems presented in the webpage https://projecteuler.net/
### Feel free to use this implementations.

## [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/tknbr/euler)
### If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
### My implementation has an input parameter. This parameter N is the number which you want the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below this number.
