 * Part of the Project Euler problems ( https://projecteuler.net )
 *
 * Maximum path sum I & II
 *
 * By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row
 * below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
 *
 *					3
 *				   7 4
 * 				  2 4 6
 * 				 8 5 9 3
 *
 * That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
 *
 * NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying 
 * every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing 
 * one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

 /**
  * This will be the solution to problem 18 & 67 of project euler. The difference of both
  * problems is the size of it. The first one can be solved using brute force, second one 
  * must be solved in a clever way.
  * Brute force solution consists in reaching all possible paths. When the triangle gets bigger
  * this solution is non-viable.
  *
  * In this problem we will introduce balanced binary trees. This will be used to represent the triangle.
  * This could be done with a struct and pointers but I personally think it will be easy to do with 
  * a matrix.
  *
  * To solve the problem in a clever way we will use dynamic programming. Starting at the bottom 
  * leaf and going up to find the max sum possible. Dividing the big problem into small problems 
  * we will finally find ourselve here:
  *
  * 				a
  *				   b c
  *
  * solution will be: a + max(b,c)
