/**
 * How are we going to face this problem?
 *
 * First we need to identify what are we asked for, this is a least common multiple of several integers.
 * 
 * How can we calculate lcm(a,b) in an efficient way?
 *
 * An eficient way is to transform lcm(a,b) to (a*b)/gcd(a,b). Now the problem is reduced to calculate the gcd of both numbers.
 * To calculate gcd in an efficient way we can use a binary gcd algorithm.
